ADFTableScrollSlow
==================

A small example of table using ADF Oracle technologies, showing a possible error while using table scroll on IE10 and Firefox.

All tables scroll are too slow when the point cursor is over the content of the table, but if the cursor is over the scrollbar, the speed is fine. As said, this behavior just happen at IE10 and Firefox. At Chrome, the speed is fine.
